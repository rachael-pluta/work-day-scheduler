To enable the employee to determine which tasks / meetings have passed and those that are upcoming, the scheduler color codes each one hour time block based on whether it is in the "past", "present" or "future".  Past timeblocks are color coded grey, current timeblocks are color coded red, and future timeblocks are color coded green.
